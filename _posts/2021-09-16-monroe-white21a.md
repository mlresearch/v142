title: 'Waking up to Marginalization: Public Value Failures in Artificial Intelligence
  and Data Science'
abstract: Data science education is increasingly becoming an integral part of many
  educational structures, both informal and formal. Much of the attention has been
  on the application of AI principles and techniques, especially machine learning,
  natural language processing and predictive analytics. While AI is only one phase
  in the data science ecosystem, we must embrace a fuller range of job roles that
  help manage AI algorithms and systems — from the AI innovators and architects (in
  CS, Math and Statistics) to the AI technicians and specialists (in CS, IT and IS).
  Also, it’s important that we better understand the current state of the low participation
  and representation of minoritized groups that further stifles the accessibility
  and inclusion efforts. However, how we learn and what we learn is highly dependent
  on who we are as learners. In this paper, we examine demographic disparities by
  race/ethnicity and gender within the information systems educational infrastructure
  from an evaluative perspective. More specifically, we adopt intersectional methods
  and apply the theory of public value failure to identify learning gaps in the fast-growing
  field of data science. National datasets of Master’s and Doctoral graduate students
  in IS, CS, Math and Statistics are used to create an “institutional parity score”
  which calculates field-specific representation by race/ethnicity and gender in data
  science related fields. We conclude by showcasing bias creep including the situational
  exclusion of individuals from access to the broader information economy, be it access
  to technologies and data or access to participate in the data workforce or data
  enabled-economic activity. Policy recommendations are suggested to curb and reduce
  this marginalization within information systems and related disciplines.
