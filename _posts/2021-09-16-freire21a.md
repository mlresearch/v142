title: Measuring Diversity of Artificial Intelligence Conferences
abstract: 'The lack of diversity of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field is nowadays
  a concern, and several initiatives such as funding schemes and mentoring programs
  have been designed to overcome it. However, there is no indication on how these
  initiatives actually impact AI diversity in the short and long term. This work studies
  the concept of diversity in this particular context and proposes a small set of
  diversity indicators (i.e. indexes) of AI scientific events. These indicators are
  designed to quantify the diversity of the AI field and monitor its evolution. We
  consider diversity in terms of gender, geographical location and business (understood
  as the presence of academia versus industry). We compute these indicators for the
  different communities of a conference: authors, keynote speakers and organizing
  committee. From these components we compute a summarized diversity indicator for
  each AI event. We evaluate the proposed indexes for a set of recent major AI conferences
  and we discuss their values and limitations.'
