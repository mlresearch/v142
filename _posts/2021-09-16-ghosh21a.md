title: Characterizing Intersectional Group Fairness with Worst-Case Comparisons
abstract: Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence algorithms have gained considerable
  scrutiny in recent times owing to their propensity towards imitating and amplifying
  existing prejudices in society. This has led to a niche but growing body of work
  that identifies and attempts to fix these biases. A first step towards making these
  algorithms more fair is designing metrics that measure unfairness. Most existing
  work in this field deals with either a binary view of fairness (protected vs. unprotected
  groups) or politically defined categories (race or gender). Such categorization
  misses the important nuance of intersectionality - biases can often be amplified
  in subgroups that combine membership from different categories, especially if such
  a subgroup is particularly underrepresented in historical platforms of opportunity.
  In this paper, we discuss why fairness metrics need to be looked at under the lens
  of intersectionality, identify existing work in intersectional fairness, suggest
  a simple worst case comparison method to expand the definitions of existing group
  fairness metrics to incorporate intersectionality, and finally conclude with the
  social, legal and political framework to handle intersectional fairness in the modern
  context.
