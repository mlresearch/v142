title: 'PreDefense: Defending Underserved AI Students and Researchers from Predatory
  Conferences'
abstract: Mentorship in the AI community is crucial to maintaining and increasing
  diversity, especially with respect to fostering the academic growth of underserved
  students. While the research process itself is important, there is not sufficient
  emphasis on the submission, presentation, and publication process, which is a cause
  for concern given the meteoric rise of predatory scientific conferences, which are
  based on profit only and have little to no peer review. These conferences are a
  direct threat to integrity in science by promoting work with little to no scientific
  merit. However, they also threaten diversity in the AI community by marginalizing
  underrepresented groups away from legitimate conferences due to convenience and
  targeting mechanisms like e-mail invitations. Due to the importance of conference
  presentation in AI research, this very specific problem must be addressed through
  direct mentorship. In this work, we propose PreDefense, a mentorship program that
  seeks to guide underrepresented students through the scientific conference and workshop
  process, with an emphasis on choosing legitimate venues that align with the specific
  work that the students are focused in and preparing students of all backgrounds
  for future successful, integrous AI research careers.
