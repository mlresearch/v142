title: Working Set Selection to Accelerate SVR Training
abstract: With the increasing demand for robust and resilient machine learning models,
  support vector machines (SVMs) are regaining attention. One of the significant problems
  in SVMs is finding the support vectors as soon as possible during the optimization
  process. This paper describes a methodology to accelerate the training by making
  certain assumptions on the data and find the support vectors near the convex hull
  of every class group. Results suggest that the methodology can provide an advantage
  over traditional training for larger datasets with specific statistical properties.
  We focus on the particular case of support vector machines for regression.
